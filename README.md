#Working Tools

This repo is being used for smaller projects that not only work, but I find use in. The individual tools were either made independent of other repos, or were moved over. Updates are in progress.

### ./furiousrecon.sh
This is my unaBASHedly mediocre attempt at making a bash script to automate some recon.

### ./bannergrabber.py
This tool is a simple banner grabber.  

### ./fuzzer.py
This is a simple Fuzzer written in Python.  Your miles may vary.

### ./NetCat.py
This is a Python Netcat tool.  

### ./simpleoverflow.c
My first C program.  This may be related to that fuzzer I mentioned above. More practice with buffer overflows
