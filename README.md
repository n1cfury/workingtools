#Working Tools

Any tools I was able to get working from other repositories have been moved here. Some of it works in Python2, some in Python3.  Updates are in progress.

### ./furiousrecon.sh
This is my unaBASHedly mediocre attempt at making a bash script to automate some recon.

### ./bannergrabber.py
This tool is a simple banner grabber.  

### ./fuzzer.py
This is a simple Fuzzer written in Python.  Your miles may vary.

### ./NetCat.py
This is a Python Netcat tool.  

### ./simpleoverflow.c
My first C program.  This may be related to that fuzzer I mentioned above.
