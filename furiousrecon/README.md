##Furious Recon

This bash script runs a few nmap scans and creates a web page to view the reports from.

Considerations:
	The file path may need to be specified. I typically ran this from a VM with shared folders on my host to allow for quick recovery in the event of issues with my VM.

ToDo: 
	Add additional documentation with screenshots and details for making this work
